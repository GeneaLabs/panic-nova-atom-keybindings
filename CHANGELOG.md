# Changelog
## [Upcoming]
- More shortcuts. Please open an issue
  (https://github.com/GeneaLabs/panic-nova-atom-keybindings/issues) if you are
  missing a shortcut that I haven't added yet.

## [Known Issues]
- Adding multiple cursors to selected lines seems to always add an additional
  cursor one line below the selected lines. This appears to be a Nova bug, and I
  haven't found a way to work around it yet.
