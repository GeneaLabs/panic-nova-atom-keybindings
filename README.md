<!--
👋 Hello! As Nova users browse the extensions library, a good README can help them understand what your extension does, how it works, and what setup or configuration it may require.

Not every extension will need every item described below. Use your best judgement when deciding which parts to keep to provide the best experience for your new users.

💡 Quick Tip! As you edit this README template, you can preview your changes by selecting **Extensions → Activate Project as Extension**, opening the Extension Library, and selecting "Atom Editor Key Bindings" in the sidebar.

Let's get started!

<!--
🎈 Include a brief description of the key bindings your extension provides. For example:
-->

**Atom Editor Key Bindings** provides key bindings from **Atom Editor**, helping you feel right at home in Nova.

## Details

<!--
🎈 To help users get a feel for how bindings provided by your extension will work in practice, consider listing them:
-->

(^ = control | ⌥ = option | ⌘ = command | ⬆️ = shift | ↑ = up arrow | ↓ = down arrow)

| Menu Item              | Binding     |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Add Cursors At End Of Line | `⌘ ⬆️ L` |
| Command Palette        | `⌘ ⬆️ P`    |
| Open Quickly           | `⌘ P`       |
| Fold                   | `⌘ ⌥ [`     |
| Unfold                 | `⌘ ⌥ ]`     |
| Move Line(s) Down      | `^ ⌘ ↓`     |
| Move Line(s) Up        | `^ ⌘ ↑`     |
| Print                  | `^ ⌥ ⌘ P`   |

We are constantly adding additional shortcuts as needed. Please submit an issue
  (https://github.com/GeneaLabs/panic-nova-atom-keybindings/issues) to have your
  favorite Atom Editor shortcuts added.

<!--
🎈 If your extension provides too many bindings to list, that's okay! Instead, consider providing an overview of what users might expect to find:
-->

<!-- Atom Editor Key Bindings offers keyboard bindings in the following categories:

- Lorem
- Ipsum
- Dolor
- Sit
- Amet -->

<!--
👋 That's it! Happy developing!

P.S. If you'd like, you can remove these comments before submitting your extension 😉
